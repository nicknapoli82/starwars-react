* Starwars People - Reactified
Pretty much exactly the same as swapi-people-lister

Used [[https://www.valentinog.com/blog/babel/][Tutorial: How to set up React, webpack, and Babel 7 from scratch (2019)] as a guide to setup frontend web dev environment.

Found that the guide is good, and sets up everything pretty much. It appears Babel doesn't really know how to work with *async* and *await* well though. So you have to add a little more to the webpack.config.json file to get that working, and you have to add an extra package. I pillaged some of the code from the Juke Workshop to get that stuff working right.

A good learning experience as far as I am concerned.

** (Note) to observer. Everything in the dist folder should work upfront
You should not have to do any thing with npm.
index.js in src is the only file that does the stuff.

Webpack generates main.js in the dist folder.

Thats it I believe.

Enjoy
